## Dynamic Programming (DP)

Dynamic programming is one of the most important technique to solve the optimization
problems. This is basically a technique or say a way to compute the results faster
for large number of inputs.
<strong> NOTE: </strong> Dp is not a data structure or related to any programming
language. It is just a programming paradigm. It is a special way to quickly solve the
problems or say a trick to reduce the time complexity of the problem.

#### Those who do not remember the past are condemn to repeat it

This technique basically revolves around the past of the algorithmic computations
and either remembering it or generating new results from the existing one.
This means that we keep track of each and every calculation we do and try to use them
for further calculations rather then computation from the start. This reduces the number
of steps and we optimize the algorithm.
