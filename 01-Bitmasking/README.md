|1.  |Find out if a number is even or odd using bitwise operator|[Source code in C++](https://github.com/soumilk/Algorithms_and_Their_Techniques/blob/master/01-Bitmasking/01-even_%26_odd.cpp)| Constant time O(1) | And (&) manipulation |
|2.  |Swap two numbers using bitwise operator         |[Source Code in C++](https://github.com/soumilk/Algorithms_and_Their_Techniques/blob/master/01-Bitmasking/02-xor_swap.cpp)| Constant time | Xor (^) manipulation |   
|3.  |Find a unique number in a sequence where every number is repeated twice except one number|[Source code in C++](https://github.com/soumilk/Algorithms_and_Their_Techniques/blob/master/01-Bitmasking/03-bitwise_find_unique-I.cpp)|O(n), n is total numbers in sequence | Xor (^) manipulation|
|4.  |Detemine that if the ith bit of a number is set(1) or not set(0) in its binary sequence|[Souce Code in C++](https://github.com/soumilk/Algorithms_and_Their_Techniques/blob/master/01-Bitmasking/04-set_or_not.cpp)|Constant Time|Bit Masking| 
|5.  |Need to set the 'i'th bit to '1' in the given number|[Source Code in C++](https://github.com/soumilk/Algorithms_and_Their_Techniques/blob/master/01-Bitmasking/05-set_ith_bit.cpp)|Constant Time| Bit Masking|
|6.  |Need to Clear the 'i'th bit to '0' in the given number|[Source Code in C++](https://github.com/soumilk/Algorithms_and_Their_Techniques/blob/master/01-Bitmasking/06-clear_ith_bit.cpp)| Constant Time| Bit Masking|
|7.  |We need to count the total number of set(1) bits in the binary representation of the number, <br> <b>Method 1:</b> Using the AND(&) operation to count the number of bits <br> <b>Method 2:</b> Using the n&(n-1) method, much efficient| [Source code in C++](https://github.com/soumilk/Algorithms_and_Their_Techniques/blob/master/01-Bitmasking/07-count_set_bits.cpp)| O(log n)| Bit Manipulation|
|8.  |We are given which certain numbers, each number is repeated 2 times in the sequence except one number, we need to find that unique number |[Source Code in C++](https://github.com/soumilk/Algorithms_and_Their_Techniques/blob/master/01-Bitmasking/08-find_unique_II.cpp)|O(n)|Xor(^) manipulation|
|9.  |We are given a sequence of numbers, every number is repeated 3 times except one number, we need to find that unique number| [Source Code in C++](https://github.com/soumilk/Algorithms_and_Their_Techniques/blob/master/01-Bitmasking/09-find_unique_III.cpp)|O(n)|Bit Manipulation|
