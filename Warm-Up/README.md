**This problem was taken from the Coursera [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms),
specifically from the Algorithmic Toolbox Course, Week 2, that Iâ€™ve recently completed.**<br>
This is really a great course for you if you want to get a good command over Algorithms and their approachs.

<p> Here, I am specifying the concepts and the logics used to solve the coding assignment problems which I where in the course,
If you don't have the course then you can follow up and solve the assignments from here.</p>
